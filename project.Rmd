# (PART) Project {-}

# Final Project {-}

## Requirements {-}

You will be analyzing a dataset using a regression, classification, and unsupervised learning analysis.

1. You must complete the Project Work parts of the 4 weekly homework assignments. These are incremental investigations that build from our applied class exercises.
2. You will synthesize these investigations at the end of the module.

**Collaboration:**

- You may work in teams of up to 3 members. Individual work is fine.
- The weekly homework assignments will note whether work for that week should be submitted individually or if just one team member should submit work.
- There will be a required synthesis of the weekly homework investigations at the end of the course (e.g., a final report and/or presentation). If working on a team, this should be done in groups, rather than individually.
    - Still being determined. Updates will appear on this page later in the course.

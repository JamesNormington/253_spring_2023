Even if you’ve already downloaded both R and RStudio, you’ll want to re-download to make sure that you have the most current versions. Highly recommended: Change the default file download location for your internet browser. Generally by default, internet browsers automatically save all files to the Downloads folder on your computer. This does not encourage good file organization practices. It is highly recommended that you change this option so that your browser asks you where to save each file before downloading it. This page has information on how to do this for the most common browsers. Required: Download R and RStudio FIRST: Download R here. You will see three links “Download R for …” Choose the link that corresponds to your computer. As of March 16, 2021, the latest version of R is 4.0.4. SECOND: Download RStudio here. Click the button under step 2 to install the version of RStudio recommended for your computer. As of March 16, 2021, the latest version of RStudio is 1.4.1106. Suggested: Watch this video made by Professor Lisa Lendway that describes essential configuration options for RStudio. Required: Install required packages. An R package is an extra bit of functionality that will help us in our data analysis efforts in a variety of ways. Open RStudio and click inside the Console pane (by default, the bottom left pane). Copy and paste the following command into the Console. You should see the text below appear to the right of the &gt;, which is called the R prompt. After you paste, hit Enter. install.packages(c(&quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;readr&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;, &quot;broom&quot;, &quot;caret&quot;)) You will see a lot of text from status messages appearing in the Console as the packages are being installed. Wait until you see the &gt; again. Enter the command library(ggplot2) and hit enter. If you see the message Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called ggplot2, then there was a problem installing this package. Jump down to the Troubleshooting section below. (Any other messages that appear are fine, and a lack of any messages is also fine.) Repeat the above step for the commands: library(dplyr) library(readr) library(rmarkdown) library(broom) library(caret) Quit RStudio. You’re done setting up! Optional: For a refresher on RStudio features, watch this video. It also shows you how to customize the layout and color scheme of RStudio. Troubleshooting Problem: You are on a Mac and getting the following error: Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘ggplot2’ in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]): there is no package called ‘rlang’ Here’s how to fix it: First install the suite of Command Line Tools for Mac using the instructions here. Next enter install.packages(\"rlang\") in the Console. Finally check that entering library(ggplot2) gives no errors. You should be good now for dplyr, readr, and rmarkdown. "],["introductions.html", "Topic 1 Introductions Envisioning an Ideal Module 4 Explorations", " Topic 1 Introductions Slides from today are available here. Envisioning an Ideal Module 4 Directions: In your breakout rooms, please first introduce yourselves in whatever way you feel appropriate (e.g., preferred name, pronouns, how you’re feeling at the moment, things you’re looking forward to). When everyone is ready, discuss the 3 prompts below and record thoughts in this Google Doc. The instructor will summarize responses from both sections to create a resource that everyone can use. Prompts: Wonderful leaders in the Macalester community have complied the following set of agreements to consider when working in small groups. Which of the following do you think are most important to keep in mind for our time together in this course and why? Confidentiality: Take the lesson, not the story Use “I” statements; Speak your truth W.A.I.T. (Why Am I Talking/Why Aren’t I Talking) Listen for understanding Unpack assumptions Extend and receive grace Understand impact vs. intention Breathe and lean into discomfort Accept non-closure What strategies have you found work well for you to succeed both in and out of class in these times? What are some things that have contributed to positive experiences in your courses that you would like to see again this module? What has contributed to negative experiences that you would like to prevent? Explorations Each of the data contexts below prompts a broad research goal. For each, sharpen the focus of that goal by coming up with more targeted research questions that: Can be studied with a regression exploration Can be studied with a classification exploration Can be studied with an unsupervised learning exploration Are there harms that you anticipate arising from the collection of data or its analysis? Context 1: The New York Times is trying to better understand the popularity of its different articles with the hope of using this understanding to improve hiring of writers and improve their website layout. Context 2: The Minnesota Department of Health is trying to better understand the different health trajectories of people who have contracted a certain illness to improve funding for relevant health services. Context 3: The campaign management team for a political candidate is trying to better understand voter turnout in different regions of the country to run a better campaign in the next election. "],["homework-1.html", "Homework 1 Project Work Portfolio Work Course Engagement", " Homework 1 STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION! Due Friday, March 26 at midnight CST on Moodle Project Work Goal: Find a dataset (or datasets) to use for your final project and start to get to know the data. Details: Your dataset(s) should allow you to perform a (1) regression, (2) classification, and (3) unsupervised learning analysis. The following resources are good places to start looking for data: Google Dataset Search Kaggle UCI Machine Learning Repository Harvard Dataverse Even if you end up working with a partner on the project, please complete this initial work individually. It’s fine if you and a potential/future partner end up using the same dataset and collaborate on the finding of data, but complete the short bit of writing (below) individually. Check in with the instructor early if you need help. Deliverables: Write 1-2 paragraphs (no more than 350 words) summarizing: The information in the dataset(s) and the context behind the data. Use the prompts below to guide your thoughts. (Note: in some situations, there may be incomplete information on the data context. That is still ok. Just do your best to summarize what information is available, and acknowledge the lack of information where relevant.) What are the cases? Broadly describe the variables contained in the data. Who collected the data? When, why, and how? 3 research questions 1 that can be investigated in a regression setting 1 that can be investigated in a classification setting 1 that can be investigated in an unsupervised learning setting Also make sure that you can read the data into R. You don’t need to do any analysis in R yet, but making sure that you can read the data will make the next steps go more smoothly. Portfolio Work Page maximum: 1.5 pages of text Organization: Your choice! Use titles and section headings that make sense to you. (It probably makes sense to have a separate section for each method.) Deliverables: Put your work in a Google Doc, and update the link sharing so that anyone with the link at Macalester College can edit. Share the URL to the Google Doc in your submission. Concepts to address: Overfitting: The video used the analogy of a cat picture model to explain overfitting. Come up with your own analogy to explain overfitting. Evaluating regression models: TBD Cross-validation: TBD Subset selection: TBD Algorithmic understanding Scaling of variables Computational time Interpretation of output Subset selection: TBD Algorithmic understanding Scaling of variables Computational time Interpretation of output Course Engagement The Ethics component below is the only required piece. The others are optional depending on the modes of engagement you wish to pursue consistently throughout the module. Ethics: Read the article Amazon scraps secret AI recruiting tool that showed bias against women. Write a short (roughly 250 word), thoughtful response about the themes and cautions that the article brings forth. Reflection: Write a short, thoughtful reflection about how things went this week. Feel free to use whichever prompts below resonate most with you, but don’t feel limited to these prompts. How is your understanding of the material? What ideas/topics have stuck out for you? How is group work going? Any strategies for improving collaboration that you want to try out next week? How is your work/life balance going? Any new activities or strategies that you want to try out for next week? Note-taking: Share link(s) to file(s) where you keep your notes on videos/readings and on code from class. Q &amp; A: In one short paragraph, summarize your engagement in at least 2 of the 3 following areas: (1) preceptor / instructor office hours, (2) on Slack, (3) in small groups during synchronous class sessions "]]

This is the class manual for Statistical Machine Learning (STAT 253) at Macalester College for Spring 2021. The content here was made by [Leslie Myint](https://lmyint.github.io) and draws upon our class textbook, [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/s/ISLR-Seventh-Printing-xwa7.pdf), and on materials prepared by [Alicia Johnson](https://ajohns24.github.io).

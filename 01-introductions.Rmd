## Envisioning a Community of Learners {-}

**Directions:**

- In your breakout rooms, please first introduce yourselves in whatever way you feel appropriate (e.g., preferred name, pronouns, how you're feeling at the moment, things you're looking forward to).
- When everyone is ready, discuss the 3 prompts below and record thoughts in [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pjyG4dFRSJWUR5IHshGekENmBMC1FDFHHG2eSsWrFns/edit?usp=sharing). The instructor will summarize responses from both sections to create a resource that everyone can use.

## Explorations {-}

Each of the data contexts below prompts a broad research goal. For each, sharpen the focus of that goal by coming up with more targeted research questions that:

- Can be studied with a regression exploration
- Can be studied with a classification exploration
- Can be studied with an unsupervised learning exploration

Are there harms that you anticipate arising from the collection of data or its analysis?

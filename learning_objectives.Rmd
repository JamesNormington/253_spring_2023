# Learning Objectives {-}

Learning objectives for our course topics are listed below. Use these to guide your synthesis of video and reading material.

**Introduction to Statistical Machine Learning**

- Formulate research questions that align with regression, classification, or unsupervised learning tasks

<br>

**Evaluating Regression Models**

- Create and interpret residuals vs. fitted, residuals vs. predictor plots to identify improvements in modeling and address ethical concerns
- Interpret MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared in a contextually meaningful way

<br>

**Overfitting and cross-validation**

- Explain why training/in-sample model evaluation metrics can provide a misleading view of true test/out-of-sample performance
- Accurately describe all steps of cross-validation to estimate the test/out-of-sample version of a model evaluation metric
- Explain what role CV has in a predictive modeling analysis and its connection to overfitting
- Explain the pros/cons of higher vs. lower k in k-fold CV in terms of sample size and computing time

<br>

**Subset selection**

- Clearly describe the forward and backward stepwise selection algorithm and why they are examples of greedy algorithms
- Compare best subset and stepwise algorithms in terms of optimality of output and computational time

<br>

**LASSO (shrinkage/regularization)**

- Explain how ordinary and penalized least squares are similar and different with regard to (1) the form of the objective function and (2) the goal of variable selection
- Explain how the lambda tuning parameter affects model performance and how this is related to overfitting
